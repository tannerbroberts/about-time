# Step 6: Badge Logic and Calculation

## Step Title & Dependencies
**Title**: Calculate and display badge values based on accounting instances  
**Dependencies**: Step 5 (Badge Implementation) must be completed first

## Detailed Requirements

### Enhanced Badge Calculation Logic
Implement sophisticated calculation logic for badges that:
1. **Efficient Computation**: Uses memoization and optimized algorithms for large datasets
2. **Real-time Updates**: Responds immediately to changes in accounting instances
3. **Hierarchical Awareness**: Properly handles parent-child item relationships
4. **Variable Aggregation**: Correctly counts and aggregates variables across complex item hierarchies
5. **Performance Monitoring**: Tracks calculation performance and optimizes as needed

### Time Calculation Enhancements
- **BasicItem Focus**: Only count time from BasicItem instances, not SubCalendar or CheckList parents
- **Completion Filtering**: Exclude currently executing items, only count completed but unaccounted items
- **Duration Accuracy**: Handle edge cases like zero duration, infinite duration, or malformed data
- **Breakdown Analytics**: Provide detailed time breakdown for tooltips and debugging

### Variable Calculation Sophistication
- **Deep Variable Collection**: Traverse item hierarchies to collect all variables
- **Deduplication Logic**: Properly count unique variables across overlapping hierarchies
- **Category Grouping**: Group variables by category for better insights
- **Quantity Aggregation**: Sum variable quantities for meaningful totals
- **Performance Caching**: Cache variable calculations to avoid repeated computation

### Implementation Details

#### Optimized Time Calculation
```typescript
// Example optimized calculation (not actual code):
const useBadgeCalculations = (instances: ItemInstance[], items: Item[]) => {
  return useMemo(() => {
    const basicInstances = instances.filter(/* BasicItem filter */);
    const totalTime = basicInstances.reduce(/* optimized sum */, 0);
    
    return {
      totalTime,
      breakdown: /* detailed analysis */,
      variableCount: /* cached variable count */
    };
  }, [instances, items]);
};
```

#### Variable Hierarchy Traversal
- Implement depth-first search for item hierarchies
- Cache intermediate results to avoid repeated traversal
- Handle circular references and malformed hierarchies
- Provide detailed logging for debugging complex cases

#### Performance Optimization Strategies
- Use React.useMemo for expensive calculations
- Implement calculation result caching with proper invalidation
- Debounce rapid data changes to avoid excessive recalculation
- Monitor calculation time and warn on performance issues

## Testing Requirements

### Performance Testing
- Benchmark calculation time with various dataset sizes (100, 1000, 10000 instances)
- Test memory usage during complex variable aggregation
- Verify calculation results remain consistent across repeated runs
- Test performance impact on main accounting view rendering

### Accuracy Testing
- Verify time calculations match manual calculations for known datasets
- Test variable counting accuracy with complex hierarchies
- Compare results with existing variable calculation systems
- Test edge cases (empty data, malformed data, circular references)

### Integration Testing
- Test badge updates when underlying data changes
- Verify memoization works correctly (no unnecessary recalculations)
- Test error handling and recovery scenarios
- Verify tooltip data accuracy and formatting

### Test Files to Create
- `src/components/accounting/utils/__tests__/badgeCalculations.test.ts`
- `src/components/accounting/utils/__tests__/variableAggregator.test.ts`
- `src/components/accounting/hooks/__tests__/useBadgeCalculations.test.ts`
- `src/components/accounting/__tests__/badgePerformance.test.ts`

- [ ] Calculations scale linearly with dataset size (no exponential complexity)
- [ ] Memory usage remains stable during repeated calculations
- [ ] No memory leaks from calculation caching or memoization
- [ ] Calculation performance is monitored and reported

- [ ] Badges update immediately when accounting instances change
- [ ] Memoization prevents unnecessary recalculations
- [ ] Debouncing handles rapid data changes efficiently
- [ ] Component re-rendering is minimized during updates
- [ ] Error states are handled gracefully with fallback values

- [ ] Time calculations properly filter BasicItem instances
- [ ] Duplicate variables are handled correctly
- [ ] Calculation errors are logged and reported appropriately

## Rollback Plan

### Performance Issues Recovery
1. **Slow Calculations**: Implement simpler calculation methods or reduce calculation frequency
2. **Memory Leaks**: Remove caching and use direct calculations
3. **UI Blocking**: Move calculations to web workers or use async processing
4. **Infinite Loops**: Add circuit breakers and maximum iteration limits

### Accuracy Issues Recovery
1. **Incorrect Results**: Fall back to simpler, verified calculation methods
2. **Complex Hierarchy Issues**: Limit calculation depth or use flattened data structures
3. **Variable Counting Problems**: Use basic variable counting without aggregation
4. **Time Calculation Errors**: Use simple duration summation without filtering

### Integration Issues Recovery
1. **Hook Integration Problems**: Move calculations to component-level state
2. **Memoization Issues**: Remove memoization and use direct calculations
3. **Real-time Update Problems**: Use manual refresh or reduced update frequency
4. **Error Handling Issues**: Implement simpler error boundaries and fallbacks

### Clean Rollback Steps
1. Remove complex calculation utilities and hooks
2. Restore simple badge calculations from Step 5
3. Remove performance monitoring and caching systems
4. Verify basic badge functionality still works
5. Remove any test files specific to complex calculations
6. Ensure accounting view performance is restored

### Partial Implementation Strategy
If full sophistication proves challenging:
1. Implement basic accurate calculations first, optimize later
2. Start with time calculations, add variable sophistication later
3. Use simple caching before implementing complex memoization
4. Focus on accuracy over performance initially
5. Add error handling and edge cases incrementally
6. Implement monitoring and debugging tools last
