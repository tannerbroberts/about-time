# Step 3: Accounting View Test Suite

## Step Title & Dependencies
**Title**: Write comprehensive tests verifying accounting view behavior during execution  
**Dependencies**: Step 1 (Test Item Creation) and Step 2 (Time Control Framework) must be completed

## Detailed Requirements

### Core Test Scenarios
Implement comprehensive tests that verify the accounting view behavior described in the requirements:

1. **Initial State Test**: Verify accounting view shows nothing during first second when parent and first child have started but not completed
2. **First Child Completion**: After 1 second, verify first child BasicItem appears in accounting view
3. **Progressive Completion**: Verify subsequent children appear at correct 2-second intervals
4. **Empty Periods**: Confirm accounting view doesn't show currently executing items
5. **Multiple Instance Handling**: Test behavior with multiple SubCalendar executions

### Edge Case Testing
- SubCalendar with no children
- Children that complete instantly
- Overlapping SubCalendar executions
- Partially completed SubCalendars
- Error conditions and malformed data

### Real-time Behavior Verification
- Test accounting view updates during live execution simulation
- Verify proper React component re-rendering
- Confirm data flow from instances to UI components
- Test sorting and filtering with time-controlled data

## Code Changes Required

### New Test Files to Create

#### `src/components/accounting/__tests__/AccountingView.integration.test.tsx`
- Complete integration tests with time control
- Test full execution lifecycle scenarios  
- Verify accounting view component behavior
- Include performance and stress testing

#### `src/components/accounting/__tests__/accountingBehavior.test.ts`
- Unit tests for accounting logic during execution
- Test useItemInstances hook behavior with time progression
- Verify instance filtering and completion tracking
- Test edge cases and error conditions

#### `src/components/accounting/__tests__/executionScenarios.test.ts`
- Specific test scenarios matching requirements
- Multi-step execution verification
- Complex timing and interaction tests

### Implementation Details

#### Core Test Structure
```typescript
// Example test structure (not actual code):
describe('Accounting View During Execution', () => {
  beforeEach(() => {
    // Setup test data and time control
  });

  it('shows nothing during first second of execution', async () => {
    // Start execution, advance to 500ms
    // Verify accounting view is empty
  });

  it('shows first child after 1 second completion', async () => {
    // Advance to 1001ms (first child complete)
    // Verify first child appears in accounting view
  });
});
```

#### Time Progression Tests
- Test execution at specific time intervals (0ms, 500ms, 1001ms, 2001ms, etc.)
- Verify accounting view state at each critical time point
- Confirm proper handling of completion timing
- Test rapid time advancement scenarios

#### Component Integration Tests
- Render AccountingView with controlled test data
- Simulate user interactions during execution
- Test filtering and sorting during time progression
- Verify proper Material-UI component behavior

### Files to Modify

#### `src/components/accounting/__tests__/AccountingView.test.tsx` (if exists)
- Enhance existing tests with time control integration
- Add execution-specific test scenarios
- Ensure compatibility with new testing framework

## Testing Requirements

### Required Test Scenarios

#### Timing Verification Tests
- [ ] T=0ms: Accounting view shows no items (parent and child 1 started but not complete)
- [ ] T=500ms: Still no items (child 1 still executing)
- [ ] T=1001ms: First child appears (child 1 completed)
- [ ] T=2001ms: Still only first child (child 2 started but not complete)
- [ ] T=3001ms: First and second children appear (child 2 completed)
- [ ] Continue pattern through all 5 children

#### Component Behavior Tests
- [ ] AccountingView component renders correctly with test data
- [ ] Instance cards display proper completion information
- [ ] Filtering and sorting work during execution
- [ ] No memory leaks during rapid time progression
- [ ] Proper error handling for malformed execution data

#### Integration Tests
- [ ] useItemInstances hook returns correct accounting instances
- [ ] Time progression triggers proper React re-renders
- [ ] Accounting view updates reflect instance completion states
- [ ] Multiple SubCalendar executions handled correctly
- [ ] Clean state transitions between test scenarios

### Performance Requirements
- [ ] Tests complete within reasonable time (< 30 seconds total)
- [ ] No significant memory usage during time simulation
- [ ] Rapid time advancement doesn't cause race conditions
- [ ] Component re-rendering is efficient during execution

### Error Handling Tests
- [ ] Invalid time progression handled gracefully
- [ ] Malformed test data doesn't crash tests
- [ ] Missing item instances handled properly
- [ ] Network errors or async failures managed correctly

## Acceptance Criteria

### Core Functionality Verification
- [ ] All timing tests pass with exact expected behavior
- [ ] Accounting view correctly filters out currently executing items
- [ ] Completed items appear promptly after execution finishes
- [ ] Multiple execution scenarios work correctly
- [ ] Edge cases handled without errors

### Test Quality Standards
- [ ] Tests use `npm run test:ai` command successfully
- [ ] All tests are deterministic and repeatable
- [ ] Clear test descriptions and error messages
- [ ] Proper setup and teardown for each test
- [ ] Good test coverage of critical execution paths

### Integration Requirements
- [ ] Tests work with existing test infrastructure
- [ ] No interference with other test suites
- [ ] Compatible with CI/CD pipeline requirements
- [ ] Proper mocking and cleanup in all scenarios
- [ ] Tests provide useful debugging information on failure

### Documentation Requirements
- [ ] Test scenarios clearly document expected behavior
- [ ] Comments explain complex timing logic
- [ ] README or documentation for running execution tests
- [ ] Examples of how to extend tests for new scenarios

## Rollback Plan

### Test Failure Recovery
1. **Timing Issues**: Fall back to simpler time intervals if precision tests fail
2. **Component Integration Problems**: Isolate component tests from execution logic
3. **Performance Problems**: Reduce test complexity or split into smaller suites
4. **Infrastructure Conflicts**: Move tests to separate test environment

### Debugging Strategy
- Detailed logging of time progression and state changes
- Snapshot testing for accounting view state at key points
- Performance profiling for slow or hanging tests
- Clear error messages for common failure scenarios

### Clean Rollback Steps
1. Remove or disable failing test files
2. Restore any modified existing test configurations
3. Ensure core accounting view functionality still works
4. Verify other test suites remain unaffected
5. Document any limitations or temporary workarounds

### Partial Implementation Strategy
If full implementation proves challenging:
1. Start with basic timing tests only
2. Add component integration gradually
3. Implement edge cases last
4. Maintain clear separation between working and experimental tests
5. Ensure core functionality remains stable throughout development
