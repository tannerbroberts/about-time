- Responsive positioning for smaller screens
- Gesture support for navigation
- Optimized performance on mobile devices

## Configuration and Customization

### Popup Appearance
- Configurable maximum width and height
- Compact mode for constrained spaces
- Theme integration with Material-UI
- Customizable positioning offsets

### Navigation Behavior
- Configurable history length limits
- Customizable keyboard shortcuts
- Optional breadcrumb display

  onEdit={(name) => console.log('Edit:', name)}
/>

// Custom popup usage
<VariableDescriptionPopup
  open={true}
  variableDefinitionId="def-123"
  variableName="flour"
  mousePosition={{ x: 200, y: 300 }}
  onClose={() => setOpen(false)}
  compact={false}
  maxWidth={450}
  maxHeight={500}
/>
```
