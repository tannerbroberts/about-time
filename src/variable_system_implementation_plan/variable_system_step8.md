# Step 8: Variable Description Popup

## Step Dependencies
- **Prerequisites**: Step 7 (Variable-based Filtering must be completed)
- **Next Steps**: Step 9 (RelationshipId-based Summaries)

## Detailed Requirements

Create an interactive popup window that appears when users click on variable chips, displaying the variable's description with navigation capabilities. The popup should focus on the mouse location, show the description text with linked variable navigation, provide back/forward navigation history, and close on click-away. This creates an immersive variable exploration experience.

### Core Requirements
1. **Mouse-focused Popup**: Popup appears at mouse cursor location when variable chip is clicked
2. **Description Display**: Show formatted variable description with proper styling
3. **Link Navigation**: Enable clicking links in descriptions to navigate to other variables
4. **Navigation History**: Back/forward navigation within the popup
5. **Click-away Dismissal**: Close popup when clicking outside of it
6. **Responsive Positioning**: Adjust popup position to stay within viewport
