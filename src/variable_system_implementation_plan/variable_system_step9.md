# Step 9: RelationshipId-based Summaries

## Step Dependencies
- **Prerequisites**: Step 8 (Variable Description Popup must be completed)
- **Next Steps**: Step 10 (Integration Testing)

## Detailed Requirements

Update the variable summary calculation system to use relationshipId instead of parentId for tracking variable contributions. This ensures accurate cumulative variable calculations when a single item is used multiple times within another item's hierarchy. The system must handle cases where one item appears multiple times as a child, counting its variables multiple times and applying cumulative updates correctly.

### Core Requirements
1. **RelationshipId Tracking**: Use relationshipId instead of parentId for variable summary calculations
2. **Multiple Usage Handling**: Correctly count variables when items are reused multiple times
3. **Cumulative Updates**: Automatically update parent summaries when child variables change
4. **Cascade Propagation**: Propagate variable updates through multiple levels of hierarchy
5. **Performance Optimization**: Maintain efficient calculation performance with relationship-based tracking
