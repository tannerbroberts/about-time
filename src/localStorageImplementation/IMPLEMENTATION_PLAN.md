# Local Storage Implementation Plan for ATP (About Time Project)

## Overview
This plan outlines a comprehensive 7-step implementation to add local storage CRUD operations for the main calendar (baseCalendar) and items array. The implementation will ensure that all changes are immediately persisted to localStorage and that the application automatically loads and displays the execution view with the current active item on page load.

## Current State Analysis
Based on codebase analysis:
- **State Management**: Uses React Context with reducer pattern (AppReducer)
- **Key Data Structures**:
  - `items: Item[]` - Array of all task items (BasicItem, SubCalendarItem, CheckListItem)
  - `baseCalendar: Map<string, BaseCalendarEntry>` - Scheduled items with absolute timestamps
- **Execution System**: Uses `getCurrentTaskChain()` to determine active tasks based on current time
- **Data Models**: Immutable items with JSON serialization support

---

## Step 1: Core Storage Service Infrastructure
**Goal**: Create foundational storage service with type-safe serialization/deserialization

### Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] Creates `localStorageService.ts` with complete CRUD operations
- [ ] Implements type-safe JSON serialization for all Item types using existing `toJSON()`/`fromJSON()` methods
- [ ] Handles Map serialization for baseCalendar (Map → Array conversion)
- [ ] Includes error handling for localStorage quota exceeded and corrupted data
- [ ] Provides fallback mechanisms when localStorage is unavailable
- [ ] Implements data versioning for future migration support
- [ ] All functions are pure and testable

### Files to Create:
- `src/localStorageImplementation/localStorageService.ts`
- `src/localStorageImplementation/types.ts`
- `src/localStorageImplementation/constants.ts`

### Key Functions:
```typescript
// Core storage operations
export function saveItemsToStorage(items: Item[]): void
export function loadItemsFromStorage(): Item[]
export function saveBaseCalendarToStorage(baseCalendar: Map<string, BaseCalendarEntry>): void
export function loadBaseCalendarFromStorage(): Map<string, BaseCalendarEntry>

// Utility functions
export function clearAllStorageData(): void
export function getStorageSize(): number
export function isStorageAvailable(): boolean
```

## Step 2: Enhanced AppReducer with Auto-Persistence
**Goal**: Integrate storage service with existing reducer for automatic persistence

### Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] Creates `enhancedAppReducer.ts` that wraps existing reducer
- [ ] Automatically persists changes for item-related actions: `ADD_ITEM`, `UPDATE_ITEM`, `REMOVE_ITEM`, `ADD_CHILD_TO_PARENT`
- [ ] Automatically persists changes for calendar actions: `ADD_BASE_CALENDAR_ENTRY`, `REMOVE_BASE_CALENDAR_ENTRY`, `UPDATE_BASE_CALENDAR_ENTRY`
- [ ] Maintains exact same API as current AppReducer (drop-in replacement)
- [ ] Includes performance optimizations (debouncing for rapid changes)
- [ ] Preserves all existing functionality and state shape
- [ ] Handles storage failures gracefully without breaking app functionality

### Files to Create:

export function importDataFromJSON(jsonData: string): void

// Validation
export function validateStoredData(): ValidationResult
export function repairDataInconsistencies(): RepairResult

// Backup/Restore
export function createBackup(): void
export function listBackups(): BackupInfo[]
export function restoreFromBackup(backupId: string): void
```

## Step 5: Development and Debug Tools
**Goal**: Create developer tools for testing, debugging, and data management

### Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] Creates debug component for storage inspection and manipulation
- [ ] Implements clear data functionality for testing

## Implementation Order & Dependencies

```
Step 1 (Storage Service) → Step 2 (Enhanced Reducer) → Step 3 (Context Provider)
                     ↓                                      ↓
Step 4 (Storage Utils) ← Step 5 (Debug Tools) ← Step 6 (Execution View)
                     ↓
              Step 7 (Integration)
```

## Testing Strategy

Each step includes comprehensive tests:
- **Unit Tests**: All utility functions and services
- **Integration Tests**: Component interaction with storage
- **Performance Tests**: Large dataset handling
- **Error Scenario Tests**: Storage failures, corrupted data
- **User Workflow Tests**: Complete user journeys

## Performance Considerations

- **Debounced Writes**: Prevent excessive localStorage writes during rapid state changes
- **Selective Persistence**: Only persist when relevant data actually changes
- **Lazy Loading**: Load data only when needed
- **Background Processing**: Use requestIdleCallback for non-critical operations
- **Storage Optimization**: Compress data where appropriate

## Error Handling Strategy

- **Graceful Degradation**: App continues working even if storage fails
- **User Notifications**: Clear error messages for storage issues
- **Automatic Recovery**: Attempt to recover from corrupted data
- **Fallback Mechanisms**: Use in-memory state when storage unavailable
- **Logging**: Comprehensive error logging for debugging

## Data Schema Evolution

- **Version Tracking**: Each stored data includes schema version
- **Migration Scripts**: Automated migration between versions
- **Backward Compatibility**: Support for older data formats
- **Validation**: Ensure data integrity after migrations

This implementation plan provides a robust, scalable solution for local storage persistence while maintaining the existing application architecture and ensuring data integrity throughout the process.
