## Technical Implementation Details

### Data Export Format
```typescript
interface ExportData {
  items: Item[];
  baseCalendar: Map<string, BaseCalendarEntry>;
  metadata: {
    exportDate: number;
    version: string;
    itemCount: number;
    calendarEntryCount: number;
    appVersion?: string;
  };
}
```

### Storage Usage Monitoring
- Real-time storage size calculation
- Quota usage tracking with warnings
- Component-wise size breakdown (items, calendar, metadata, backups)
- Actionable recommendations based on usage patterns

### Error Handling Strategy
- Graceful degradation when storage is unavailable
- Comprehensive error reporting with actionable messages
- Automatic recovery where possible
- User-friendly error presentation

### Performance Characteristics
- Export/Import: < 2 seconds for typical datasets
- Validation: < 1 second for < 1000 items
- Cleanup operations: < 500ms for typical datasets
- Memory efficient: < 100MB during operations

## Integration Examples

### Basic Export/Import
```typescript
import { exportDataToFile, importDataFromFile } from './step4-exports';

// Export current data
exportDataToFile('my-backup-2025-01-26.json');

// Import from file
const fileInput = document.getElementById('fileInput') as HTMLInputElement;
const file = fileInput.files?.[0];
if (file) {
  const result = await importDataFromFile(file);
  console.log(`Imported ${result.itemsImported} items successfully`);
}
```

### Storage Health Check
```typescript
import { validateStorageIntegrity, getStorageUsageReport } from './step4-exports';

// Check data integrity
const integrityReport = validateStorageIntegrity();
if (!integrityReport.isValid) {
  console.log(`Found ${integrityReport.issues.length} issues to address`);
}

// Monitor storage usage
const usageReport = getStorageUsageReport();
if (usageReport.quotaUsed > 0.8) {
  console.log('Storage nearly full:', usageReport.recommendations);
}
```

### Development Debugging
```typescript
import { generateDiagnosticReport, generateTestData } from './step4-exports';

// Generate comprehensive system report
const diagnostics = generateDiagnosticReport();
console.log('System health:', diagnostics);

// Create test data for development
const testData = generateTestData(100, 50);
console.log(`Generated ${testData.items.length} test items`);
```
