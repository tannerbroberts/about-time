# Step 5: Manual Testing Guide

## Overview

This document provides comprehensive manual testing procedures for the enhanced breakfast lesson implementation. Use this guide to validate the end-to-end functionality after completing all technical integration tests.

## Pre-Testing Setup

### 1. Environment Preparation
```bash
# Ensure development environment is running
npm run dev

# Open browser to application
# Navigate to localhost:3000 (or your dev port)
```

### 2. Clear Previous Data (if needed)
- Open browser developer tools (F12)
- Go to Application tab > Local Storage
- Clear any existing ATP data for clean testing

## Manual Testing Scenarios

### Test 1: Enhanced Breakfast Lesson Creation

**Objective**: Verify the breakfast lesson creates correctly with all enhancements

**Steps**:
1. Click on "Create Random Item" or similar button
2. Look for breakfast/cooking related option
3. Click to create the enhanced breakfast lesson
4. Verify lesson appears in item list

**Expected Results**:
- Lesson created successfully

- Variable assignments visible (if applicable in UI)
- No console errors

**Pass/Fail**: â¬œ

---

### Test 2: Variable System Verification

**Objective**: Confirm variables are properly assigned and displayed

**Steps**:
1. Open the created breakfast lesson
2. Navigate through setup, cooking, and cleanup phases
3. Look for variable indicators (ingredients, equipment, consumables)
4. Check that different tasks have appropriate variables

**Expected Results**:
- Setup tasks show cleaning/organizing variables
- Cooking tasks show ingredients (bacon, eggs, pancake mix) and equipment (pans, spatulas)
- Cleanup tasks show consumables (dish soap, paper towels)
- Variable summaries calculate correctly

**Pass/Fail**: â¬œ

---

### Test 3: Realistic Timing Validation

**Objective**: Verify timing feels realistic for actual cooking

**Steps**:
1. Review the lesson structure and timing
2. Check individual task durations
3. Validate total lesson time is around 70 minutes
4. Assess if timing allows for actual cooking pace

**Expected Results**:
- Individual cooking tasks: 1-10 minutes each
- Critical cooking tasks have appropriate buffer time
- Total lesson duration: ~70 minutes
- Timing feels achievable for learning cooks

**Pass/Fail**: â¬œ

---

### Test 4: Execution View Enhancement

**Objective**: Test enhanced execution display during lesson execution

**Steps**:
1. Start executing the breakfast lesson
2. Navigate to execution view
3. Observe status displays during different phases
4. Check countdown timers and status indicators

**Expected Results**:
- Current active task clearly displayed
- Countdown timers visible when appropriate
- Status bar shows current phase and progress
- Gap periods handled gracefully
- Visual indicators distinguish active vs. upcoming tasks

**Pass/Fail**: â¬œ

---

### Test 5: SubCalendar Status Bar Testing

**Objective**: Verify enhanced status bar functionality

**Steps**:
1. During lesson execution, focus on the status bar
2. Observe behavior during active cooking tasks
3. Watch transitions between tasks
4. Check countdown displays during gaps

**Expected Results**:
- Status bar shows current cooking task status
- Countdown displays when no active child
- Visual indicators for preparation hints
- Smooth transitions between states
- Performance remains responsive

**Pass/Fail**: â¬œ

---

### Test 6: Multi-tasking and Parallel Tasks

**Objective**: Test handling of overlapping cooking tasks

**Steps**:
1. Execute lesson through cooking phase
2. Observe when multiple tasks should be active simultaneously
3. Check status displays for parallel tasks
4. Verify guidance for managing multiple activities

**Expected Results**:
- Multiple active tasks handled correctly
- Clear guidance on prioritization
- Status displays remain accurate
- No conflicts in timing or display

**Pass/Fail**: â¬œ

---

### Test 7: Critical Cooking Moments

**Objective**: Test behavior at important cooking transitions

**Steps**:
1. Focus on key cooking moments:
   - Bacon flipping time
   - Pancake cooking transitions
   - Egg cooking timing
2. Verify status and countdown accuracy
3. Check preparation indicators

**Expected Results**:
- Critical moments highlighted appropriately
- Countdown accuracy at transition points
- Clear instructions for time-sensitive tasks
- Adequate warning for upcoming critical tasks

**Pass/Fail**: â¬œ

---

### Test 8: Performance and Responsiveness

**Objective**: Verify system performance during lesson execution

**Steps**:
1. Monitor performance during full lesson execution
2. Check for lag or delays in updates
3. Verify smooth animations and transitions
4. Test on different devices if possible

**Expected Results**:
- Real-time updates remain smooth
- No noticeable performance degradation
- Transitions are fluid
- Battery usage reasonable on mobile devices

**Pass/Fail**: â¬œ

---

### Test 9: Error Handling and Edge Cases

**Objective**: Test system robustness

**Steps**:
1. Try pausing/resuming during execution
2. Test browser refresh during lesson
3. Try navigating away and back
4. Test with very fast or slow completion times

**Expected Results**:
- Graceful handling of interruptions
- State preservation across navigation
- Recovery from unexpected scenarios
- Clear error messages if issues occur

**Pass/Fail**: â¬œ

---

### Test 10: Regression Testing

**Objective**: Ensure existing functionality still works

**Steps**:
1. Create and execute a basic (non-cooking) item
2. Test CheckList items functionality
3. Verify other SubCalendar items work correctly
4. Check that existing lessons/items continue to function

**Expected Results**:
- Non-cooking items work as before
- CheckList functionality preserved
- No breaking changes to existing features
- All item types continue to execute correctly

**Pass/Fail**: â¬œ
