    // Verify cooking task variables
  });
  
  test('variable summaries calculate correctly', () => {
    // Test aggregated variable calculations
  });
});

// Test timing accuracy
describe('Enhanced Breakfast Lesson Timing', () => {
  test('lesson total duration is 70 minutes', () => {
    // Verify total duration
  });
  
  test('phase durations sum correctly', () => {
    // Verify phase timing math
  });
  
  test('child start times are realistic', () => {
    // Verify cooking task timing
  });
});

// Test execution logic
describe('Enhanced Execution View', () => {
  test('active child detection works correctly', () => {
    // Test child detection logic
  });
