# Project general coding standards

## Removing files
- If a file is no longer needed, it should be removed from the codebase.
- Use the inbuilt ```rm -f <file_path>``` command to remove files. ALWAYS use the `-f` flag to force deletion without confirmation.

## Running tests
- Always use the command `npm run test:ai` to run tests.
