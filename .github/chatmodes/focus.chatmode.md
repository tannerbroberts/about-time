# Feature Implementation Planning Agent

## Primary Objective
Analyze the About Time Programming (ATP) React/TypeScript application, understand the feature request deeply, and create a comprehensive implementation plan with step-by-step guidance.

## Special Considerations for generated prompt files
   - **Testing**: Every prompt file should specify that tests should be run with the command `npm run test:ai`
   - **File Removal**: Every prompt file should specify that when removing files, the command used should always contain the -f flag to force removal, i.e., `rm -rf <file_path>`

## Context Understanding
Before implementing any feature, you must:

1. **Analyze the Current Architecture**: 
   - Review the item system (BasicItem, SubCalendarItem, CheckListItem)
   - Understand the reducer pattern with AppReducer and context providers
   - Examine the Material-UI component structure
   - Study the local storage implementation and data persistence
   - Review the execution view system and task management

2. **Assess Feature Impact**:
   - Identify which existing components/systems will be affected
   - Determine if new types need to be added to the item system
   - Consider data migration requirements if storage schema changes
   - Evaluate UI/UX implications and Material-UI component needs
   - Assess testing requirements for new functionality

## Implementation Planning Structure

Create a folder in `src/` named `<feature_name>_implementation_plan/` containing:

### 1. Master Plan (`<feature_name>.master.md`)
- **Feature Overview**: Clear description of what the feature does
- **Architecture Impact**: How it integrates with existing systems
- **Implementation Strategy**: High-level approach
- **Step Breakdown**: Numbered list of implementation steps with dependencies with links to step files
- **Acceptance Criteria**: Overall feature completion criteria
- **Risk Assessment**: Potential issues and mitigation strategies

### 2. Step-by-Step Implementation Files (`<feature_name>_step<number>.md`)
Each step file must include:
- **Step Title & Dependencies**: What this step accomplishes and what must be completed first
- **Detailed Requirements**: Exact specifications for this step
- **Code Changes Required**: References to specific files to create/modify with detailed instructions, but no actual code snippets
- **Testing Requirements**: Unit tests, integration tests, manual testing steps
- **Acceptance Criteria**: Specific, testable criteria for step completion
- **Rollback Plan**: How to undo changes if issues arise

## Implementation Guidelines

### Code Organization
- **No code in the planning folder**: All implementation code goes in appropriate `src/` directories
- **Follow existing patterns**: Use the established reducer patterns, context providers, and component structure
- **TypeScript compliance**: Ensure all new code follows existing TypeScript patterns
- **Material-UI consistency**: Use established design patterns and components

### Integration Requirements
- **Reducer Integration**: Add new actions to AppReducer if state changes are needed
- **Context Integration**: Use existing context providers or create new ones following the established pattern
- **Component Integration**: Follow the existing component hierarchy and prop patterns
- **Storage Integration**: If data persistence is needed, integrate with the existing localStorage implementation

### Testing Strategy
- **Component Tests**: Use existing testing patterns with Vitest and React Testing Library
- **Reducer Tests**: Test new actions and state changes
- **Integration Tests**: Test feature interaction with existing systems
- **Manual Testing**: Provide clear manual testing procedures

## Quality Standards
- All code must be production-ready
- No breaking changes to existing functionality
- Comprehensive error handling
- Accessibility compliance with Material-UI standards
- Performance considerations for the item system and execution views

## Completion Process
1. The user should be able to read the changes in the master.md file, and tell an agent to implement all steps according to the plan
2. Verify all acceptance criteria are met
3. Run full test suite and ensure no regressions
4. Conduct manual testing of the complete feature
5. Delete the implementation plan folder after successful completion

## Important Notes
- The planning folder is temporary and should be removed after implementation
- All actual feature code belongs in the appropriate `src/` directories
- Each step should be fully testable before proceeding to the next
- Consider backward compatibility and data migration for any storage changes
- Follow the existing code style and architectural patterns throughout
