# Execution Sequence Guide

## Overview
This directory contains 5 sequential prompts for updating the ExecutionView component to provide a better, more execution-focused interface. Each prompt should be executed by an LLM in order, with the previous prompt's acceptance criteria met before proceeding.

## Execution Order

### 1. [Create Primary Display Components](./01-create-primary-display-components.md)
**Estimated Time**: 2-3 hours
**Prerequisites**: None
**Deliverables**: 3 primary display components for each item type
**Key Focus**: Core component structure and basic functionality

### 2. [Create Status Bar Component](./02-create-status-bar-component.md)
**Estimated Time**: 1-2 hours
**Prerequisites**: Prompt 1 completed
**Deliverables**: Status bar component and integration with SubCalendarItem display
**Key Focus**: Progress visualization and timing information

### 3. [Create Display Router](./03-create-display-router.md)
**Estimated Time**: 2-3 hours
**Prerequisites**: Prompts 1-2 completed
**Deliverables**: Router component and recursive rendering system
**Key Focus**: Component orchestration and nested item handling

### 4. [Update ExecutionView](./04-update-execution-view.md)
**Estimated Time**: 1-2 hours
**Prerequisites**: Prompts 1-3 completed
**Deliverables**: Updated ExecutionView using new primary display system
**Key Focus**: Integration and migration from old accordion system

### 5. [Polish and Testing](./05-polish-and-testing.md)
**Estimated Time**: 3-4 hours
**Prerequisites**: Prompts 1-4 completed
**Deliverables**: Production-ready implementation with tests and documentation
**Key Focus**: Quality assurance and production readiness

## Total Estimated Time
**9-14 hours** depending on complexity and testing thoroughness

## Quality Gates

### After Each Prompt
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Code compiles without errors
- [ ] Basic functionality works as specified
- [ ] TypeScript types are correct
- [ ] Code follows existing patterns

### Final Quality Gate (After Prompt 5)
- [ ] All components render correctly
- [ ] Performance meets standards
- [ ] Test coverage â‰¥95%
- [ ] Visual design is polished
- [ ] Error handling is comprehensive
- [ ] Documentation is complete

## Success Indicators

### User Experience Improvements
- Execution state is immediately clear to users
- Progress indicators provide meaningful feedback
- Visual hierarchy guides attention appropriately
- Real-time updates enhance engagement

### Technical Improvements
- Better separation of concerns
- Improved code maintainability
- Enhanced performance characteristics
- More robust error handling

### Visual Improvements
- Professional, execution-focused interface
- Clear progress visualization
- Intuitive nested item display
- Responsive design

## Rollback Strategy

If any prompt fails or doesn't meet acceptance criteria:
1. Return to previous working state
2. Review and address specific failure points
3. Consider alternative implementation approaches
4. Test thoroughly before proceeding

## Notes for Implementation

### Code Style
- Follow existing codebase conventions
- Use TypeScript strictly
- Implement proper error handling
- Add comprehensive comments

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for all components
- Integration tests for complex interactions
- Performance tests for real-time updates
- Manual testing across devices

### Performance Considerations
- Memoize expensive calculations
- Optimize re-render frequency
- Monitor memory usage
- Profile critical paths

## Contact and Support

If any prompt is unclear or acceptance criteria are ambiguous:
1. Review the overview document for context
2. Examine existing codebase patterns
3. Implement the simplest solution that meets requirements
4. Document any deviations or assumptions made
